# LLM workflow dependency pins (used by agents-auto-pilot.yml)
# Rationale:
# - These are standalone runtime pins for workflow LLM steps, not app deps.
# - These pins intentionally drift from pyproject.toml/requirements.lock so
#   workflow automation can upgrade independently; no consumer dependency
#   change is required when bumping this file.
# - Use strict X.Y.Z pins to keep workflow installs reproducible.
